7BBG2016 Advanced BioinformaticsR/RStudio assessment
In this assessment you will be asked to perform a number of tasks in R/RStudio and report them in your own markdown document. 
[x] Initial task: Create a new markdown document in RStudio, 
[x] set the title to "Advanced Bioinformatics 2019 assessment", 
[x] and insert an "author:" tag below the title, followed by your student id. 
[-] Share your markdown document and html via your github account.

In the following, for each task, 
[x] create a new heading called "Task X" for task X, 
[x] and insert a new R code chunk that holds any code required. 
[x] Make sure to evaluate the expression before saving to include the output in the html file. 
[x] If you have multiple lines that produce outputs, you can split them into separate code chunks for increase clarity (but it is not necessary to pass the assessment). 
[x] Please also write out any explanations.

1. 
[x] Using the sum() function 
[x] and : operator, 
[x] write an expression in the codesnippet to evaluate the sum of all integers between 5 and 55. 

2. 
[x] Write a function called sumfun 
[x] with one input parameter, called n, 
[x] that calculates the sum of all integers between 5 and n. 
[x] Use the function to do the calculation for n = 10, 
[x] n = 20, 
[x] and n = 100 and 
[x] present the results. 

3. The famous Fibonacci series is calculated as the sum of the two preceding members of the sequence, where the first two steps in the sequence are 1, 1. 
Write an R script 
[x] using a for loop to calculate 
[x] and print out the 
[x] first 12 entries of the Fibonacci series. 

4. With the mtcars dataset bundled with R, 
[x] use ggplot to generate a box of miles per gallon (in the variable mpg) as a function of the number of gears (in the variable gear). 
[x] Tip: use the as.factor function to convert the gear variable from numeric into factor. 
[x] For bonus point: use the fill aesthetic to colour bars by number of gears 
[x] Tip: see ggplot2 cheat sheet at RStudio.com for different ggplot options). 

5. 
[x] Using the cars dataset 
[x] and the function lm, 
[x] fit a linear relationship between speed (in units of mph) and breaking distance (in units of feet) in the variable distance.

[x] What are the fitted slope 
[x] and intercept of the line, 
[x] and their standard deviations? 

6. 
[x] Use ggplot to plot the data points from Task 6 and the linear fit. 

7. 
[x] Again using the cars dataset, now use linear regression (lm) to estimate the average reaction time for the driver to start breaking (in seconds). 
[x] To simplify matters you may assume that once breaking commences, breaking distance is proportional to the square of the speed. 
[x] You may also use that 1 mile = 5280 feet and 1h = 3600 seconds. 
[x] Note that you'll need to use the I() function in the regression formula to make sure any non-linear terms gets treated literally, rather than as combinations of factors (e.g. I(x^2) for a term quadratic in the variable x). 

[x] Do you get reasonable results? Yes
[x] Finally, use ggplot to plot the data points and the fitted relationship.
